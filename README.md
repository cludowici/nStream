Licensing: MIT license, like CC-BY for code which means do whatever you want with it, with an attribution to the author.

The basis of this experiment was Alex's [attentional blink repository](https://github.com/alexholcombe/attentional-blink).

This repo contains many-streams RSVP experiments, data, mixture modelling code and analysis documents in many branches, each of which constitutes a different experiment or project. Expect more documentation (and a cleaner repo) when the paper comes out. 

* Experiments: Python and Psychopy
* Mixture modelling: Matlab (old), R (new)
* Analysis: R
* Analysis Notebooks: R Markdown
